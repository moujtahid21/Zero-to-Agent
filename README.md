# 🚀 Zero to Agent: Your Guide to Building AI Agents 🤖
Welcome to the official repository for the Zero to Agent series! This project is a comprehensive, hands-on guide to understanding, building, and deploying intelligent AI agents from the ground up.

This repository contains all the source code, examples, and resources that accompany our step-by-step blog series. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you'll find everything you need to start your journey into the world of agentic AI.

## ✨ What You'll Learn
- ✅ Core Concepts: Grasp the fundamental principles behind AI agents, workflows, and architectures.

- ✅ Practical Skills: Write code to build your own agents, from a single-function agent to a collaborative multi-agent system.

- ✅ Modern Frameworks: Get hands-on experience with powerful frameworks like KaibanJS, CrewAI, and AutoGen.

- ✅ Advanced Techniques: Explore cutting-edge topics like Agentic RAG, long-term memory, and model evaluation.

- ✅ Enterprise-Ready Systems: Understand the architectural considerations for building scalable and reliable AI services.

## 🗺️ Our Learning Roadmap
This repository is structured to follow our blog series. Each step will have its own dedicated folder and resources.

- [ ] 1. Introduction: Setting the stage for our journey.

- [ ] 2. 🏗️ Build an Agent from Scratch: Writing our very first line of agentic code.

- [ ] 3. 🖼️ AI Agent Frameworks: Comparing and using tools that accelerate development.

- [ ] 4. 🎭 Types of AI Agents: Exploring the zoo of agents: from simple tools to cognitive architectures.

- [ ] 5. ⚙️ Workflow vs. Agent: Understanding the critical difference between static processes and dynamic agents.

- [ ] 6. 🏛️ Agent Architectures: Designing the "brain" of a single, effective agent.

- [ ] 7. 🤝 Multi-Agent Architectures: Learning how to make multiple agents collaborate effectively.

- [ ] 8. 🏙️ Building a Multi-Agent System: Putting theory into practice with a team of agents.

- [ ] 9. 🧠 Agentic Memory: Giving your agents the ability to remember and learn.

- [ ] 10. 📚 Agentic RAG: Supercharging your agents with external knowledge.

- [ ] 11. 📜 Model Context Protocol (MCP): Mastering the flow of information between models.

- [ ] 12. 📊 Evaluation: Measuring the performance and reliability of your creations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
While we will explore various tools, our core stack will include:

- **Languages**: JavaScript/TypeScript & Python

- **Frameworks**: KaibanJS, CrewAI, AutoGen

- **LLMs**: OpenAI API, Hugging Face Models, and others

- **Platform**: Node.js, Python Environments

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started and follow along with the tutorials:
1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/zero-to-agent.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory:
`cd zero-to-agent`
3. Follow the instructions in each lesson's folder! Each part of the series will have its own `README` with specific setup instructions (e.g., `npm install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`).

**Prerequisites:**
- An API key from an LLM provider (like OpenAI).
- Node.js and/or python installed on your machine.
